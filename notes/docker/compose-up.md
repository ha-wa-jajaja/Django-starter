## `docker-compose up`

### Creates <mark>Container(s)</mark>

-   One container is created for each service defined in your docker-compose.yml file. Each container runs with the configuration specified for that service.

### Creates <mark>Networks</mark>

-   A default bridge network is created to allow your containers to communicate with each other. Any custom networks defined in your compose file are also created.

```yml
# docker-compose.yml

# ...
services:
    webapp:
        image: nginx:latest
        networks:
            - frontend
            - backend
        ports:
            - "80:80"

    api:
        image: node:14-alpine
        networks:
            - backend

    database:
        image: postgres:13
        networks:
            - backend
        environment:
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example

    # As api and database only specifies the backend network,
    # they're able to contact with each other and webapp but not the frontend network.

networks:
    frontend:
        # The bridge driver is built into Docker.
        # Docker also supports other built-in network drivers
        driver: bridge
        ipam:
            config:
                - subnet: 172.28.0.0/16

    backend:
        driver: bridge
```

### Creates <mark>Volumes</mark>

-   Containers are ephemeral by design (their data disappears when they're removed), but applications often need to store data persistently, therefore **Volumes** in Docker are a mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers

### Creates <mark>Images</mark>

-   An image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run an application:

1. **Code**: The actual application code that will run.
2. **Runtime**: The necessary programming language runtime (like Python, Node.js, etc.).
3. **Libraries**: Any dependencies or libraries needed by your application.
4. **System tools**: Common utilities and tools needed for operation.
5. **System libraries**: Required system-level libraries.
6. **Settings**: Default configuration values.
